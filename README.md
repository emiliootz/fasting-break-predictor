# Fasting Break Predictor

Machine Learning project to predict how likely your are to break your fast

The goal of this project is to measure the factors that may lead someone to break their fast
wether they're doing a 3-day, 5-day, or 7-day fast. 

## Data

The data in this project was gathered by personally doing a 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day fast and inputing the
info (features) every waking hour during the fast and 

## Features

Hunger Level: Self-rated hunger on a scale from 1 (not hungry) to 10 (extremely hungry)

Time of Day: Morning, Afternoon, or Evening

Mood: Self-rated mood on a scale from 1 (low/stressed) to 10 (great/happy)

Hours Fasted: The number of hours since the last meal

Fasting Length: Duration of the fasting period (3-day, 5-day, or 7-day fast)

Tempting Food Availability: Scale of 1 to 10 indicating the presence of tempting foods nearby

Social Context: Whether the person is alone, with friends, or with family

Craving Intensity: Self-rated craving intensity on a scale from 1 (mild) to 10 (intense)

Craving Type: Type of craving: Salty, Sweet, or Savory

Break Fast: Whether the fast was broken (Yes/No)

## Analysis and Modeling

I used Jupiter Notebook to analyze the data and present graphs and code (octave) 

## Findings

While working on this project a few findings that I am looking for:

How much does the feature of craving influence your ability to continue the fast for the desired time?

How does time of day play into type and amount of cravings you have?

How does the desired fasting time impact the ability to complete the fast succsesfully?

How does social context impact the ability to complete your fast? (Social gatherings with friends and family, dinners, hangouts etc.). 

Are there any additional features that may impact your ability to complete your fast? (sleep quality, physical activity)
